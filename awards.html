            <p>This means we are in the final 5 in revelation category, with 3 awards being granted, gold, silver and bronze, in each category.<br>
              1) Ballyhoura Farmhouse Cider<br>
              2) Orleans Oak Spiced Vinegar<br>
              3) Apple Chai Shrubs Sweet Drinking Vinegar.</p>
