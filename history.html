	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The Ballyhoura Apple Farm  started in Churchtown Co. Cork in 2006. It started with the planting of 1000  trees and was able to plant 1000 more in the spring of 2007. A further 2500  apple trees were planted in the spring of 2008. In 2014 the company purchased  the old Molex factory in Kilfinane and they transported the entire orchard to Kilfinane and 95%  of their trees survived the trip. </p>

	<section><p>The company believes that new  innovative food products with apples as a base has unlimited potential. They  have a number of new innovative apple based products. The company started out  from a market and sold juices on a stall. They then expanded their market to  local butchers, Centras and Supervalues in the Limerick area. When they purchased  the factory in Kilfinane they expanded their business nationwide. They now sell  products to Supervalue, Centra, Aldi and Lidl nationwide. They have numerous  tasting awards and best product awards.</p>
      <p>The business was started by  Maurice Gilbert in 2006 in his home town Churchtown but didn&rsquo;t grow till local  millionaire and business partner Gerry Murphy invested in the businesses in  2007. Now the business has a lot of investors and potential for high growth  especially through the internet. The new investors have given the company the  chance to grow all their own ingredients with the purchase of new lands. The  company now grows its own beetroots, carrots, lemons and most recently have  added cherry trees to their orchard.</p>
